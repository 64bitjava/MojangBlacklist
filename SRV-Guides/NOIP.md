### How to setup SRV records with No-IP
1. Login to your NoIP account & make your way to the [old site](https://www.noip.com/members/dns/)
2. Go through the standard process of creating a new host.<br> ![Step 2](https://i.tcpr.ca/QLoZrU7)
3. After creating the host, go to the Manage Hosts tab, select the host that you just made & then click on SRV in the "Advaned Records" row.<br> ![Step 3](https://i.tcpr.ca/Oioel8q)
4. Copy the following picture, but make sure to set the target as one of your own a records. (Not the one you just made)<br> ![Step 4](https://i.tcpr.ca/1szT47b)
5. Click submit. Everything should now work just like it used to and it'll be easier for you to change domains if Mojang blacklists you. No need to get your players to try different domains, all you have to do is change the target domain for the SRV record & everything will work fine.<br>
